Formally modeling and verifying the most prevalent DHT protocol - Kademlia.
Define the system states and transitions, define and verify the properties of Kademlia.
The focus is on the dynamically-changed membership \ie churning scenario that Kademlia (along with most p2p works) works with, which not only exposes challenging transitions but also affects the statements of properties.

The work may or may not deal with Kademlia specifically.
If so, the contributions are
\begin{itemize}
    \item Iterate the model into a more practical form compare to previous efforts (which are to be investigated), especially regarding the churning.
    \item Closely relate the verification with functional production in reality.
    In another word, make a system paper out of the idea.
    \item Optionally reasoning about Byzantine faults.
\end{itemize}

Alternatively, the work may be generalized into a universal logic and library for verifying churning networks.
Either reusable facts or impossibilities would be useful.
And again, reasoning about Byzantine faults is probably welcomed but not a must.
